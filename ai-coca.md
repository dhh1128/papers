# AI User Code of Conduct

<span class="hash">#ai #trust #ethics</span>

>*I'm publishing this document to be publicly accountable and transparent about my intentions with respect to this important and [ethically complex](ctf.pdf) technology. The principles below seem important to me, but of course I encourage you to write your own document like this if you feel inspired. For ideas on code of conduct for AI _builders_, I thought [this open letter](https://openletter.worldethicaldata.org/en/openletter/) was insightful*.

Like all tools, AI confers power â€” for good or ill. To safeguard trust and human well being, I pledge to follow the guidelines below in my own use of AI.

## 1. Be truthful
I will not use AI to create content to deceive. I will not use an AI to interact with others in a way that violates reasonable expectations about the humanness, identity, or presence of their counterparty.

## 2. Respect boundaries
I will not use AI to violate social norms such as courtesy, privacy, personal space, and benefit of the doubt.

## 3. Accept responsibility but give credit
I accept responsibility for what an AI does under my direction. When I produce content with an AI's help, I will acknowledge the AI's contribution according to the reasonable expectations of my audience.

## 4. Provide safeguards and backchannels
I will take sensible measures to protect others from egregious mistakes made by AIs that I control or influence. I will allow people to escalate to me, short-circuiting layers of AI, when this is important.
