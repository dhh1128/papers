Each item in the archive is assigned a stable, human-readable item identifier using the following convention:  
**CC-XXX-YYMMOO**, for example `CC-PAP-250802`. The prefix `CC` denotes the Codecraft publishing namespace. The second segment (`XXX`) consists of the first three characters of the document’s category name, uppercased (e.g., `PAP` for Papers, `SPE` for Specifications, `PRI` for Primers). The final segment encodes time and ordering: `YY` is the two-digit year of initial publication, `MM` is the two-digit month of initial publication, and `OO` is a two-digit ordinal indicating sequence within that year.

This identifier is intended to be **permanent and immutable**. Once assigned, it must never change, even if the document’s filename, URL slug, or rendered formats change. The identifier refers to the conceptual work, not to any specific representation of it (HTML, PDF, etc.). Versioning is handled separately via an explicit version field (e.g., semantic versioning), allowing multiple versions of the same document to share a single document identifier.

The identifier is designed to balance rigor and practicality: it is short enough to be cited and discussed by humans, structured enough to convey category and chronology, and stable enough to function as a long-term reference for indexers, citation tools, and AI systems. UUIDs, Git commit hashes, or content hashes may be recorded as internal provenance metadata, but they are not used as the public document identifier.
