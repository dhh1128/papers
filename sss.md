I just got a new mobile phone and phone number. You can guess the hoop-jumping that ensued as I installed apps and updated dozens of account profiles.

One adjustment on my to-do list was Signal. I use Signal on my phone to chat securely and privately with friends; naturally I wanted it on my shiny new device…

Well, it turns out that’s much trickier than it sounds. Signal installs on new devices just fine, but its account security is tied to control of a phone number — a new identifier that is rented by my employer rather than owned by me — and [Signal is unwilling to let me transfer the binding](https://web.archive.org/web/20200227005300/https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007062012-New-Number-or-New-Phone). I have to start over from scratch. (EDIT, Aug 2024: this seems to have changed since I wrote the original post. Cool!)

This is not a rant against Signal (I understand their rationale). Nor is it an exploration of clever workarounds (which may exist). Rather, this is a meditation on a lesson that the Signal friction taught me. I should have understood it long ago, perhaps — but the epiphany was slow in coming. I’m slapping my forehead.
